        <h2>How can it be implemented?</h2>
        <p>Respect sometimes is taken for granted in how important it is, its something we don't often realize
            how much it matters in our day to day lives until it is gone completely, and of course,
            this applies to businesses, and it is pretty much a REQUIREMENT for businesses if you want to be productive.</p>

        <h2>How can it be used?</h2>
        <p>Respect is a powerful tool, one example to this is how influential it is.
            If you are a boss to a group of people, you obviously need to act like a leader and they follow suit,
            but that is very hard when you are seen as some asshole with a heart of stone.
            Then how would you fix that? Well with respect! Having and showing respect to the group
            is important for a leader, and when it is done, you can expect the same treatment back,
            allowing you to be a good leader overall.
            To add onto this reason, this will help decrease overall arguments and conflicts, allowing more...
            civilized discussions in different ideals, being more open and critic on the topic.
            When respect is used at its peak, it can be very big in bonds, how efficient the business is,
            how the business is seen from an outsider, and overall just allowing the business reach
            to higher heights than it ever has before!</p>

        <h2>How can it be gained?</h2>
        <p>Gaining/creating respect between workers can be easily made by doing trust activities
            or make them interact with each other. This allows them to bond and grow a sense of familiarity
            between each other, feel personally connected in some way instead of being seen as another
            random worker or boss in others eyes.
            Another idea is showing feedback or general acknowledgement to the workers.
            If a worker or boss says something and you have an opinion on, say it!
            Show that you are listening to them and say your feelings and opinions on it,
            and what you can do to act out said idea, this would then be done the same back to you, which leads to growing respect.</p>
